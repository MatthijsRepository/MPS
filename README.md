# MPS
MPS Finite Temperature Purification Model

This page contains the python code used to simulate quantum spin chains at finite temperature using MPS. It is based on the previous works of A Melo, P. Vree and J. Bouwmeester, with changes to support state purification.

The code used for figure creation is also attached, however it is not recommended to use this as it is not very user friendly.

The code labeled "exact" calculates the exact solution using the density matrix. Be aware that for long chains (L>12) this will take very long to run. 

Required packages: numpy, matplotlib, time, os
