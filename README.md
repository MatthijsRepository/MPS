# MPS
MPS Finite Temperature Purification Model

This page contains the python code used to simulate quantum spin chains at finite temperature using MPS. It is based on the previous works of A Melo, P. Vree and J. Bouwmeester, with changes to support state purification.

The code used for figure creation will be added later.

Required packages: numpy, matplotlib, time, os
